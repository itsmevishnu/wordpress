Customize the login form of traditional WordPress  site

== Description ==
Customising the WordPress login page will change the overall look and feel of the website. The users will feel that they use their own CMS.
Normally the customization requires some more attention and coding skills because we need to know the working of WordPress, filter and action mechanism, and some functions.
That can be done by a well-experienced WordPress developer.
